<h3><a class='anchor' name='Seminar%20Presentation%20(10%)'>Seminar Presentation (10%)</a></h3>

<p>A short seminar presentation/demonstration of a SuperCollider project.
<p><strong>Deadline</strong>: 14 and 17 February 2017 (in class).<h3><a class='anchor' name='Portfolio%20of%20Work%20(60%)'>Portfolio of Work (60%)</a></h3>

<p>A performance, improvisation, composition, installation or demonstration using SuperCollider.
<p><strong>Deadline</strong>: Dates for performances/presentations to be negotiated with tutor.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Written%20Documentation%20(30%)'>Written Documentation (30%)</a></h3>

<p>A piece of writing (1500 words) analysing the way the practical work relates to the artistic, technological and theoretical subjects explored in the project.
<p><strong>Deadline</strong>: 18 April 2017 by 16:00 (hand-in at Music Reception).<h2><a class='anchor' name='Assignment%20Brief'>Assignment Brief</a></h2>

<p>Throughout this module, you will be introduced to themes related to computer music, digital audio and interactivity. You will study subjects including computer programming, signal processing, sound synthesis, algorithmic composition, audio analysis, interaction, human interface devices, live electronic performance and generative music. You will also examine the creative possibilities of these technologies through experimentation in your own practice. You will be learning and working with the SuperCollider programming language as your main platform to explore computer music.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Seminar%20Presentation'>Seminar Presentation</a></h3>

<p>You will present a seminar of 15 minutes explaining a small-scale SuperCollider project that will be later developed for your portfolio of work. You will explain how your code works in detail as well as how it addresses your creative and/or research objectives. You will need to give evidence of understanding how the different components of the code operate and work together for the desired outcome. Examples of work could include a prototype for a synthesis instrument to be used in a live performance, a signal processing effect for music production, a piece of code that generates a short algorithmic composition, or a program that analyses MIDI infomration for musicological research. In your presentation you will demonstrate a good grasp of programming concepts and coding practices.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Portfolio%20of%20Work'>Portfolio of Work</a></h3>

<p>For your final portfolio of work (comprising 60% of your mark) you will produce a performance, improvisation, composition, installation or demonstration with the SuperCollider programming language. You will work in groups to produce a piece of work that will last a minimum of 15 minutes. The work presented will consist of a creative or research project that will utilise computer programming and music technologies for your own creative or professional practice. For this project you will work in groups of 2 or 3, however every member of the group will have to present their work individually (develop separate code and individual written documentation). You will be responsible not only for your own work, but for making sure that the collaboration is successful.
<p>Your project should demonstrate a good working knowledge of SuperCollider. You may choose to combine SuperCollider with other software – you may for example use other software like Max, Ableton Live, or Sibelius depending on the nature of your project. Your code will have to run in real-time without errors. You should also demonstrate the ability to use SuperCollider in your own creative and professional practice to design your own programs to be incorporated into your process/workflow. You should demonstrate through your work that you have responded to the module themes, understand key topics in computer music, and that you have the ability to specialise in areas of computer music that are relevant to your creative practice/research.
<p>Your practical project will need to be negotiated before it is approved.<h3><a class='anchor' name='Written%20Documentation'>Written Documentation</a></h3>

<p>Your written documentation (30%) will be a 1500-word piece of writing explaining the research and reasoning behind the creative output submitted as the portfolio of practical work. This piece of writing should be a critical reflection on your work, with well-developed arguments grounded on research using reliable academic sources. It should be a serious piece of writing addressing technical and aesthetic issues and should not simply be a list of things you did for the practical project. Even though you will be working in groups, it is crucial that your written documentation focuses on your unique contribution and on your own code.
<p>As part of your submission you should also include documentation of the project (recording, video, photos, etc.) as well as your code, which should run without errors. All supporting materials used in the patch – audio files, video files, external libraries, etc. should be included.
<p>In your written documentation, you should seek to:<ul>
<li>Explain the initial concept/idea for the project<li>Show evidence of the research you have done for the project<li>Include the patch/code you developed and supporting materials (audio/video, recordings, photos, etc.)<li>Explain your creative (musical, artistic and aesthetic) or research process and aims<li>Demonstrate that your collaboration with the other members in your group was successful<li>Present your documentation in an organised way and write clearly with use of standard academic language<li>Exhibit a fair amount of critical thinking about your project and that you critically evaluated the creative or research outputs (what are the conclusions?)</ul>

<p>You should respond to the following criteria that will be evaluated:<ul>
<li>Concept/idea of project (project, written documentation)<li>Research (project, written documentation)<li>Programming skills (patch/code, written documentation)<li>Realisation and creative or research outputs (project, written documentation)<li>Project management and collaboration (project, written documentation)<li>Presentation (project, written documentation)<li>Critical evaluation (project, written documentation)</ul>

<p>The work that you submit as written documentation should include:<ol>
<li>1500 word piece of writing (printed - 2 copies). In your written documentation you should credit all of the people that were involved in the project (any collaborators), as well as any samples of music or sounds by other people that you used in your project.<li>A CD/DVD or USB drive containing the following:<ul>
<li>Word, Text or PDF of the written documentation.<li>Code and supporting materials (audio, video and image files, external libraries, etc.)<li>Documentation (any audio/video recordings of your performance/installation, photographs, other documentation)</ul>
</ol>

<p>The written documentation has to be handed-in by 16:00 on the 18th of April at the Music Reception in Sally Baldwin Buildings - Block D. Please do not leave things to the last minute and bear in mind that it might be wise for you to hand-in your project with enough time before the submission deadline. Also, please make sure that your disk, patches, files, etc. work on different computers/platforms before you hand it in. If your disk or code does not work you will fail the assignment.<div class='doclink'>helpfile source: <a href='file:///Users/federicoreuben/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/ComputerPlay/HelpSource/Assignment Brief.schelp'>/Users/federicoreuben/Library/Application Support/SuperCollider/Extensions/ComputerPlay/HelpSource/Assignment Brief.schelp</a><br>link::Assignment Brief::<br>sc version: 3.8.0</div></div></body></html>
